#### **Pistols** (All LC3)
See **B278** or **High-Tech** page 101 for stats
1. Lewis Dalton Solutions Fundum, .45 ACP (2d pi+)
	1. Based heavily on the designs of the company president's ancestors, the LDS Fundum is a powerful, if expensive magnum favored by those looking for sheer power over considerations like accuracy or ammo capacity.
	2. (Stats of the "Colt Government, .45 ACP")
3. Glock 17, 9mm (2d+2 pi)
	1. Almost entirely unchanged since its invention in the 20th century, the Glock 17 is an effective, reliable weapon. In the modern era it has been updated to be compatible with high-tech accessories, but its basic functionality remains as simple as ever.
	2. (Stats of the "Glock 17, 9x19mm")
4. ILZ Hammer, .40 (2d+1 pi+)
	1. A powerful handgun favored by spacers expecting to get into short encounters like bar fights. It has low capacity compared to a 9mm, but is easy to conceal and packs a wallop against unarmored targets.
	2. (Stats of the "Kahr K40, .40 S&W")
5. Dragonfly, .50 (4d pi+)
	1. A huge, long pistol famous for its devastating effects on targets. It is expensive, inaccurate, heavy, kicks like a mule, and is unwieldy, but it makes a big statement to own and wield one.
