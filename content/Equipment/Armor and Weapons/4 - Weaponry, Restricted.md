If you wish, please feel free to come up with a new company/brand name for your weapon. If you want to use a piece of armor not on this list and it is approved by the GM, come up with a brand name / model number for the item.

1. AR-915, .556 (4d+2 pi)
	1. A popular design for civilian and militaries alike, the AR-915 is the fully-automatic version of this rifle, issued most frequently to mercenary groups and armed security. Individuals wielding this rifle almost always load it with armor-piercing rounds, allowing it to punch through anything short of full combat armor, with a high rate of fire that ensures it'll still tear up lightly-armored targets.
	2. (Stats of the "Colt M4A1")
2. IK-421, 7.62 (5d+1 pi)
	1. One of the most enduring designs of automatic rifle ever produced, the Izhmash-Kalashnikov model 421's blueprints are public domain and are produced by manufacturers all over the Terran sector. It is not quite as precise as its competitor, the AR-915, and is heavier and bulkier, but it is also less expensive and packs a bit more of a punch.
#### Light Machine Guns, or Squad Automatic Weapons
See **B281** or **High-Tech** page 137 for stats
	1. BDA X3, 7.62 (7d)
		1. A common weapon seen as a heavy auto-turret and a standard-issue weapon for power-armor wearing soldiers. Auto-turrets frequently fire standard ammunition, while soldiers often load with armor-piercing rounds.
