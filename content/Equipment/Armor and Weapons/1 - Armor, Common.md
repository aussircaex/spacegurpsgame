If you wish, please feel free to come up with a new company/brand name for your armor. If you want to use a weapon not on this list and it is approved by the GM, come up with a brand name / model number for the weapon.

	4. With a large amount of raw iron available from asteroids in the Barren Shores region the company, Barren Shore Armorers, are able to manufacture reliable full-metal armors with modern metallurgy techniques at reasonable costs. The armors are made of quality steel, but are consistent with contemporary aesthetics popular with spacers. The armor is quite heavy, and so is popular among guards and mercenaries who can spend time training to use it effectively.
3. **Kev-Max Armored Clothing**
	1. Any regular article of clothing can be made with Kev-Max brand ballistic armoring weave, giving it the stats of Reflex armors (**HT172**) Also see **HT175** for more customization options. The following are common baseline options:
	2. Jacket: *Arms, Torso; DR 12/4vs.crush; $450; 3lbs; LC3*
	3. Vest: *Torso; DR 12/4vs.crush; $300; 2lbs; LC3*
	4. Bodysuit: *Torso, Groin Legs, Arms; DR 12/4vs.crush; $900; 6lbs, LC3*
#### Headgear
1. **REFLEC-T "Quasimodo" Helmet**
	1. *Skull; DR 8; $100; 5lbs, LC4*
	2. Also called the "Bell-Ringer", REFLEC-T's off-the-shelf steel helmets come in a variety of styles and colors, suitable for protecting your head while also allowing you to represent your affiliation with style.
2. **REFLEC-T "Frollo" Helmet**
	1. *Skull; DR 4; $60; 3lbs, LC4*
	2. The inexpensive option for the frugal yet fashionable gang member, the Frollo comes in a narrower range of styles and colors, allowing for less self-expression from the wearer. And it doesn't protect the head as well.
3. **SAYFGARD Systems Light Helmet**
	1. *Skull; DR 18, $250; 3lbs, LC3*
	2. add Visor: *Eyes, face; DR 10; +$100, +3lbs, LC3*
	3. Known as a far more reputable brand than REFLEC-T, SAYFGARD offers strong protection to the public at reasonable prices, all using techniques and materials that do not break interstellar restrictions on high-tech arms and armor. While their full armor solutions are their trademark, they sell more helmets than suits for fairly self-evident reasons.
4. **Solar Flare Protective Eyewear**
	1. *Eyes, DR 10, $100, 0.1lbs, LC 4*
	2. The ultimate balance between badass fashion and self-protection. Not only will you be able to see your opponents coming thanks to these glasses' state-of-the-art auto-adjusting EM filters, glare-compensating vibro-lines, and optional enemy-highlighting HUD (coming soon!), you'll be sure to see them going, as these shades come with the highest levels of anti-ballistic protection.
