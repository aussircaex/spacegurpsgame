A list of approved items you can generally expect to be able to find for purchase in the Terran Sector.

- **Ammunition**: Your gun's Weight stat has two numbers; the one after the slash is how much one full load of ammo weighs. A reload costs that weight times $20. So for a Glock 17, a magazine of 17 bullets weighs 0.6lbs and costs $12.
	- Hollow-point ammo is available at the same price.
	- Armor-piercing ammo costs twice as much as a baseline. It is also LC2, so you can only get it from smugglers and other illegal arms dealers, who charge double again (for a total of 4x the price).

##### Medicine
- **Doctor's Bag** (HT220) - A kit containing the basic equipment required for the Physician skill, and can serve as improvised tool for Surgery. Provides +1 to First Aid if available. $200


Meal pack $2, 1lb per meal, shelf life 20 years, usually taste pretty good
Survival Rations - $5. 0.5lb per meal, shelf life 30 years, taste is tolerable

Human Feed Goop - Produced by the Universal Union to provide sustenance to its subjects without having to actually grow crops or raise livestock. A popular conspiracy theory is that it is made of people. This is likely untrue, because it's not made of anything that was originally organic. It seems to be nothing but synthesized proteins meant to sustain a subject population. It is an unappetizing grey-brown color. It is *delicious*; people can't get enough of the stuff, and many corporations still produce it to this day. One day's food in a convenient tube is $10 and weighs 0.75lbs.
