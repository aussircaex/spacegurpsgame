A list of approved items you can generally expect to be able to find for purchase in the Terran Sector.

##### Ammo
- Your gun's Weight stat has two numbers; the one after the slash is how much one full load of ammo weighs. A reload costs that weight times \$20. So for a Glock 17, a magazine of 17 bullets weighs 0.6lbs and costs \$12.
	- Hollow-point ammo is available at the same price.
	- Armor-piercing ammo costs twice as much as a baseline. It is also LC2, so you can only get it from smugglers and other illegal arms dealers, who charge double again (for a total of 4x the price).
##### Medicine
- **First Aid Kit** (UT198): \$50, 2lbs.
	- Contains six free Bandage Sprays among its other contents.
	- Gives +1 to First Aid skill (and is not consumed).
- **Crash Kit** (UT198): $200, 10lbs.
	- Contains six free Bandage Sprays among its other contents.
	- Gives +2 to First Aid skill (and is not consumed).
	- Can serve as improvised (-5) tools for Surgery.
- **Bandage Spray** (UT197): \$3, 0.1lbs.
	- One-use can of spray-on antiseptic bandages that also provide a topical analgesic. Available in flesh-tones, colors, and dinosaur patterns.
	- If used for initial bandaging, it works in 5 seconds as opposed to the normal 1 minute.
	- If used as part of a Field Dressing, provides +2 to First Aid (does not stack with your equipment bonus)
- **Physician's Equipment, Medbay** (UT199, modified): \$100, 5lbs.
	- Drugs and other disposable supplies and tools for using the Physician skill.
	- This is 1/5 the price of the "Medical Supplies (TL9)" item, but does not provide the +1 Quality bonus.
- **Surgical Instruments, Medbay** (UT199): \$300, 15lbs.
	- Complete, if basic, set of tools necessary for surgery in a small ship medical bay.
	- Treated as TL9 for this purpose, meaning it gives +3 bonus to Surgery checks.
	- Surgery is necessary to stabilize patients who reach -1xHP or worse, or who receive crippling injuries, such as to a limb.
##### Food
Fresh food is always best, but spacers are always sure to stock up on food supplies.
	*n.b. Jeeves must replace his batteries three times a day, and we're just going to assume it costs the same as whatever supplies you're using. And that he needs space in the fridge and freezer. Work with me here.*
- **Fresh Food:** \$9, 6lbs per day.
	- You can store 40 days of food in your kitchen, including the fridge and freezer.
	- Note that you need 5 meals per day to feed the four of you and Dorothea.
	- Your fresh food will go bad after a week in space. *You do not need to track when your food goes bad unless you actually are out for over a week.*
- **Meal pack**: \$6, 3lb per day, shelf life 20 years
	- Usually taste pretty good, and can heat and cool themselves.
	- Commonly bought for longer journeys or with many people onboard.
- **Survival Rations**: - \$15. 1.5lb per day, shelf life 30 years
	- Taste is tolerable but very bland.
	- What's important about these is that they're lightweight. If your ship crashes, a wise spacer will prioritize taking their survival rations with them.
- **Human Feed Goop**: - $10, 0.75lbs per day (1 tube), literally never expires
	- Produced by the Universal Union to provide sustenance to its subjects without having to actually grow crops or raise livestock. A popular conspiracy theory is that it is made of people. This is likely untrue, because it's not made of anything that was originally organic. It seems to be nothing but synthesized proteins meant to sustain a subject population. It is an unappetizing grey-brown color.
	- It is *delicious*; people can't get enough of the stuff, and many corporations still produce it to this day.
	- Hard to produce in high volume and in high demand. You usually can't get more than a box of 5 at a time, since they're always sold out.
