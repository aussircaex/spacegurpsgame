The "Terran Sector" refers to the region of space populated by humanity. It has never been unified under a single government, except in the sense that all of humanity was subjugated under the [[The Universal Union]].

Comprised of approximately one hundred star systems with many settled planets and moons, Terran space is emerging from a dark age of sorts after the Great Burning of Earth, which resulted in the deaths of about two-thirds of all humanity.

Travel around the Terran sector is mostly accomplished with Warp engines (Alcubierre Drives), which are able to travel approximately one light-year per day, depending on the ship.
