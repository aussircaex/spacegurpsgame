The Infinite Suns are a large mercenary company headquartered on Schwartzchild Station, which sits at the nearest Lagrange point near a small stellar-mass black hole in sector 1009.

They are well-regarded in the Terran Sector, particularly in the Intersystems region; a region with stars on its outer ring and "empty" space in the middle that is nevertheless high in population - the region is rich in space stations, asteroid mines, and (unterraformed) rogue planets with permanent settlements.

Infinite Suns draws its recruits from other mercenary companies, offering generous buyouts of the recruit's contracts. Many other mercenary companies compete to "carry" or "feed" their best soldiers so as to sell them off to Infinite Suns for large payouts. IS recruiters must therefore be observant enough to ascertain the true capabilities of candidates and see through the deception of those groups.

Infinite Suns agents are referred to as "Suns" or "Type GIs", and are always well-armed and armored when on duty, and are highly trained in squad tactics.

When on individual assignment Suns frequently subcontract other mercenaries for assistance. The subcontracted mercs are often far less trained and capable than the Sun, but are often highly enthusiastic and destructive in their attempts to impress them.

Squads of Suns are typically only seen on the most expensive jobs, and are efficient, coordinated, and deadly.
