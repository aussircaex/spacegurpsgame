The basic process of a making an attack:

1. Roll your relevant skill with the weapon you chose. If you fail, you miss.
2. If you hit, the target can roll to defend.
	1. They can Block once per round
	2. They can Parry, but take -4 cumulative each additional time they try to Parry
	3. They can always Dodge (but it's hardest to increase Dodge)
3. If they fail to defend, roll damage
4. Deduct the target's Damage Reduction from the damage
