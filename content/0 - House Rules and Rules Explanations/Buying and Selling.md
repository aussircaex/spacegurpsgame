When buying off-the-shelf equipment or goods, you can simply purchase them when shops are available. When buying big-ticket goods or when selling goods, see below:

The "base price" when **buying** is equal to its market price.

The "base price" when **selling** is 80% for inexpensive trade goods that can be turned around quickly. For example, foodstuffs recovered from a derelict ship.

The "base price" when **selling** is 50% for unique, expensive, or hard-to-resell goods. For example, fine-quality weapons, or spaceships.

1. If you **critically fail** (get a 17, 18, or fail by 10 or more on any check here), the merchant instantly rejects you. This might mean telling you to leave, but it might also mean violence if their guards are twitchy.
2. When you find a merchant, you can either make an offer or ask them for a price. The GM will make a **reaction** roll.
	- If you offer a price first, the reaction roll will determine whether they accept your price immediately. If your price is too much (or too little, when buying), they'll simply refuse.
	- If you ask a price first, the reaction roll will determine their initial price. You can take it, or counter-offer a price. The reaction roll will determine if they accept your counter-offer
3. If they're willing to haggle after that:
	- If you offered first, you can make a new offer. If you counter-offered, they'll make a new, slightly better offer, and then you make a new offer.     
    - Optionally, roleplay an Influence skill to talk up the merchant. Success gets you a bonus on the next roll, but a failure means a penalty.       
    - Make an opposed Merchant roll. Success and failure determine how much they'll adjust the price (for example, if you're trying to buy a ship and fail this roll, he'll lower the price, but only by a small amount relative to your offer).        
    - You can either accept the price now, or make a new offer. You can only use a given Influence skill once per negotiation.        
    - Repeat until you accept a price, or the merchant reaches their Final Offer.
