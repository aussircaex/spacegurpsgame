- In order to cover some of the necessary-but-infrequently-used skills for living in space, you may purchase a specially-house-ruled custom Talent advantage which we will call Starship Crew.
    
    - Cost: 3 points / level (max 4 levels) [not the usual 5/level]
        
    - You get +1 / level to the following skills: **Crewman (all), Environment Suit (any), Free Fall, Computer Operation, Electronics Operation (all), Gunner (all)**.
        
    - You do not get the usual bonuses to reaction rolls or quicker learning for a Talent with this one, it's just the skills.
        
    - This doesn't replace needing to put at least 1 point into these skills to get that first big +4
        
    - You can still level the skills separately if you choose; this is just intended to be a cheap way to improve all of them (e.g. instead of buying your 4th rank of Computer Operation for 4 points, you could buy a rank of Starship Crew for 3 and improve all of them)
        
    - To add it to your sheet in GCS, add the Trait "Talent (@Small@) 1" to your sheet. Then double-click the talent _on_ your sheet. Edit the name to "Talent (Starship Crew)", edit the Cost Per Level to 3, change the name of the listed skills to the six listed above ("Spacer" for Crewman), and remove the "Gives a reaction modifier" feature.
- You can assume you are protected by a Force Shield from all directions, not only front-and-shield-side. Thus, you can always add +3 to your Block, Parry, and Dodge rolls.
- Anyone who is in the two-hex-wide line targeted by a Suppression Fire attack must make a Fright check. You don't get the +5 bonus for being "in the heat of battle" for this. This is to make up for the fact that as-written, Suppression Fire is so inaccurate it doesn't actually disincentivize anyone.
