Now that you understand the basic process of a making an attack, let's add more details:

1. Roll your relevant skill with the weapon you chose. If you fail, you miss.
	1. Always check for range penalties. The Measure Distance tool will calculate it for you
	2. Did you Aim last turn(s)? Add your bonus to hit.
	3. You can choose to Attack, or make an All-Out-Attack, for +1 to hit (ranged) or +4 to hit (melee), but if you do so, you cannot Defend until your next turn.
	4. If using a gun, decide how many shots you're firing, up to your weapon's Rate of Fire (RoF). If firing 5+ shots, you get a bonus to hit.
		1. For each margin of success equal to your gun's Recoil rating, you hit with an additional bullet.
2. If you hit, the target can roll to defend.
	1. They can Block once per round.
		1. Shield is an Easy skill, so is cheap to get a good score in.
		2. You cannot Block bullets, but wearing a shield provides a passive bonus to Dodge anyway
	2. They can Parry, but take -4 cumulative each additional time they try to Parry.
		1. Parry uses your weapon skill, so it's efficient to level, but hard to use repeatedly.
		2. You can't Parry bullets, but you CAN parry against a gunshot if they're within melee range, by knocking away the gun. Wearing a shield provides a passive bonus to all Parry rolls.
		3. The -4 cumulative penalty is reduced to -2 if you're using a "fencing weapon"
		4. You can't parry with a gun itself, so you can't parry if you're wielding a two-handed gun.
		5. Against an attack firing multiple shots, one Parry success avoids all shots.
	3. They can always Dodge (but it's hardest to increase Dodge)
		1. You can optionally "Dodge and Drop", aka "hit the deck" and drop prone to get +3 on all Dodge rolls against *one* opponent for that turn.
		2. Against an attack firing multiple shots, each margin of success is an additional bullet avoided (e.g. if your Dodge is 9 and you roll an 8, you avoid 2 bullets from that attack).
		3. Wearing a shield provides a passive bonus to all Dodge rolls, to simulate the shield protecting you even if you didn't intentionally block with it.
3. If they fail to defend (or partially fail to dodge multiple shots), roll damage for all attacks that hit.
4. For each *separate* attack/bullet that hits, deduct the target's Damage Reduction from the damage.
	1. Certain weapons, such as guns using armor-piercing ammo, multiply or divide the target's DR.
	2. *After* deducting DR, multiply the resulting damage depending on damage type (e.g. Impaling damage is doubled after DR).
