Guns, as it turns out, are very deadly, and you don't want to get shot, because you might die. So here's some basics of how to not get shot in GURPS while also making sure your enemies DO get shot:

### Defense

#### Don't Get Hit - Take Cover and Get Down! 
1. The parts of you behind cover (e.g. your legs) are protected by the cover; anyone who tries to attack protected parts of you take -2 to hit, and if they hit, have to get through the cover's DR on top of your armor.
	- A one-inch-thick table is only 1 DR, but it's better than nothing for the -2 to hit you. Other types of cover add up to high DR quickly - so usually I'll just ignore it unless you're behind very light cover.
2. If you're behind normal kinds of "half cover" (a chest-high wall, an overturned table, a corner wall), then half of your torso is considered to be protected, and thus enemies have -2 to hit you with an ordinary center-mass shot.
3. Being behind total cover is useful since actions like reloading can take multiple turns.
4. Changing posture such as getting up from prone to kneeling is usually a Maneuver, though you can take advantage of Dodge and Drop if you are standing "exposed" and are shot at.
5. **HOWEVER**, you can switch between Kneeling and Standing as your "step" you can do with many other actions. Kneeling imposes no penalty to your ranged attacks, but enemies take -2 to hit you - and you're often able to use more cover! A normal "flow" for combat could thus be "turn 1: stand from kneeling and Aim, turn 2: fire, then kneel from standing"

#### Wear armor!
1. You don't have many HP, so your armor will save your life!
2. Most enemies will target your torso, since it's the easiest to hit and there's no cap on damage.
3. It's harder for enemies to target your limbs or hands/feet, and there's a damage cap if they do hit you, but you should still consider how to protect your limbs. Your legs might often be behind cover, but your arms won't be.
4. Wear a helmet. Attacking your head is a large penalty, but it's really bad to get shot in the head.
5. 


Shooting Blind: Shoot around the corner without looking. -10 penalty to your attack, maximum 9, whichever is worse.
Opportunity Fire: "Ready action" to shoot if a target appears. Can cover multiple hexes, at a penalty (B390). You can only Aim if you focus on one hex only.
Pop-up attack: Step out of cover, attack, step back into cover, all in one turn. -2 to hit, and you can't benefit from Aim first. If an enemy is waiting with Opportunity Fire, they can shoot you with your reduced/lack of cover
Shotguns: Shotguns are simply always considered to be using the Rapid Fire rules, so if you fire 2 shots from a shotgun with a RoF of "3x9", you have fired 18 bullets - you get the appropriate bonus to hit for Rapid Firing, and shotguns typically have a very low Recoil rating, so you will get typically get a good number of hits, though each pellet's damage is relatively low. Armor is thus very effective against shotguns, but they're easy to get hits in with.
Suppression Fire: With a weapon with a RoF of 5 or greater, you can lay down Suppression Fire. This is an All-Out Attack (meaning, notably, you can move half your speed as well) Pick a target "zone" two hexes across. A straight line two hexes wide is "suppressed" and **(HOUSE RULE)** anyone in that zone must make a Fright check **(/HOUSE RULE)**. In addition, you must make an attack against anyone who appears in that zone (or is there and not behind total cover when you start), up to your Rate of Fire maximum. Your attack roll cannot exceed 6+ your Rapid Fire bonus (e.g. it cannot exceed 7 when firing 5 shots.), or 8+Rapid Fire bonus if using a mounted weapon.
