Guns, as it turns out, are very deadly, and you don't want to get shot, because you might die. So here's some basics of how to not get shot in GURPS while also making sure your enemies DO get shot:

### Defense

#### Don't Get Hit - Take Cover and Get Down! 
1. The parts of you behind cover (e.g. your legs) are protected by the cover; anyone who tries to attack protected parts of you take -2 to hit, and if they hit, have to get through the cover's DR on top of your armor.
	- A one-inch-thick table is only 1 DR, but it's better than nothing for the -2 to hit you. Other types of cover add up to high DR quickly - so usually I'll just ignore it unless you're behind very light cover.
2. If you're behind normal kinds of "half cover" (a chest-high wall, an overturned table, a corner wall), then half of your torso is considered to be protected, and thus enemies have -2 to hit you with an ordinary center-mass shot.
3. Being behind total cover is useful since actions like reloading can take multiple turns.
4. Changing posture such as getting up from prone to kneeling is usually a Maneuver, though you can take advantage of Dodge and Drop if you are standing "exposed" and are shot at.
5. **HOWEVER**, you can switch between Kneeling and Standing as your "step" you can do with many other actions. Kneeling imposes no penalty to your ranged attacks, but enemies take -2 to hit you - and you're often able to use more cover! A normal "flow" for combat could thus be "turn 1: stand from kneeling and Aim, turn 2: fire, then kneel from standing"

#### Wear armor!
1. You don't have many HP, so your armor will save your life!
2. Most enemies will target your torso, since it's the easiest to hit and there's no cap on damage.
3. It's harder for enemies to target your limbs or hands/feet, and there's a damage cap if they do hit you, but you should still consider how to protect your limbs. Your legs might often be behind cover, but your arms won't be.
4. Wear a helmet. Attacking your head is a large penalty, but it's really bad to get shot in the head. All damage dealt to your head ("skull" or "eyes") is quadrupled after DR!
5. At a high tech level like our game, low-tech metal armors (B283-284) are automatically double the DR listed in the Basic Set (or you can have the listed DR for half the cost and weight) and are always TL4, so they're decently effective at a low cost.
	1. You can usually imagine these items as coming in a modern/futuristic style, not literally looking like medieval technology.

### Offense

#### Make Sure You Hit Your Target!
1. The simplest way to ensure a hit is to take a turn to Aim! This adds your weapon's Accuracy stat to your next attack roll. If you're wielding a one-handed pistol in two hands, add another +1.
	1. You can Aim multiple turns in a row, adding another +1 each time. The normal maximum is Aim+2, reached at 3 turns of Aiming.
2. Adding scopes to your weapon can improve your Aim maneuver.
	1. A x2 scope adds +1, a x4 +2, a x8 +3, etc.
	2. You must Aim for a number of rounds equal to the bonus to get that bonus.
		1. With a *fixed-power* scope, that means that if you have a x4 scope, Aiming for 1 round gets you nothing extra, but aiming for 2 rounds gets you +2.
				Example: Katie has a x8 fixed scope on her 9mm pistole (Acc 2). She Aims one turn, getting +2 (for its Acc). She Aims a second turn, getting another +1 (+3 total). She Aims a third turn, getting another +1, and getting the +3 for her x8 scope, making her total bonus +7
		1. With a *variable-power* x2/x8/x16 scope, you get +1 for 1 round of Aim,+1 for 2 rounds, +3 for 3 rounds, and +4 for 4 rounds (or more)
				Example: Bernie has a x2/x4 variable-power scope on his .44 revolver (Acc 2.) He Aims one turn, getting +2 (for its Acc) and +1 for the x2 scope (+3 total). He Aims a second turn, getting another +1, and improving the scope's bonus to +2 (+5 total). He Aims a third turn, getting another +1, for +6 total.
3. You can add a simple Laser Sight to your gun for a flat +1 to hit, regardless of whether you Aim or not. However, the target also gets +1 to Dodge if they can see the dot.
4. Firing a ton of shots helps! If your weapon has a Rate of Fire of 5 or more, you get a flat bonus to hit. Fully-automatic rifles can achieve this, but civilian LC3 ones typically do not exceed RoF3. Shotguns firing buckshot are always considered to be using these rules - if you fire 2 shots from a shotgun with a RoF of "3x9", you have fired 18 times for the purposes of the rules - you get the appropriate bonus to hit for Rapid Firing, and shotguns typically have a very low Recoil rating, so you will get typically get a good number of hits, though each pellet's damage is relatively low. Armor is thus very effective against shotguns, but they're easy to get hits in with.
5. **HOWEVER**: You can still Defend yourself while Aiming, but if you do, *you sacrifice your accrued Aim bonuses!*
	1. Highly-trained squads use tactics like suppressive fire to draw the attention of enemies or make them "keep their heads down" to allow their marksmen to accrue Aim bonuses safely to make their shots.

#### Use Tactics!
Some combat actions you can take include:
1. **Shooting Blind**: Shoot around the corner without looking. -10 penalty to your attack, maximum 9, whichever is worse. But you can stay completely in cover and still make some attacks!
2. **Pop-up Attack**: Normally you can "step" between Kneeling and Standing as part of another maneuver. This means that you're exposed for one turn and in cover the next. If you want to avoid this, you can use a Pop-up Attack to leave cover, fire, and step back into cover. You take a -2 penalty to hit, and cannot benefit from Aim. This is more accurate than Shooting Blind, but enemies using Opportunity Fire or Suppression Fire can shoot at you in reaction! 
3. **Opportunity Fire:** This is the "Ready action". Pick an area of one or more hexes (1 minimum, maximum your whole "cone" of vision) and take the **Wait** maneuver. You will automatically shoot at a target that appears in that area (including popping out of cover). You take an attack penalty if you were covering a larger area than 1 hex.
	1. If you target only 1 hex, you are also considered to be Aiming.
4. **Suppression Fire:** With a weapon with a RoF of 5 or greater, you can lay down Suppression Fire. This is an All-Out Attack (meaning, notably, you can move half your speed as well) Pick a "target zone" two hexes across. A straight line two hexes wide between you and the zone is "suppressed". You must make an attack against anyone who appears in that zone (or is there and not behind total cover when you start), up to your Rate of Fire maximum. Your attack roll cannot exceed 6+ your Rapid Fire bonus (e.g. it cannot exceed 7 when firing 5 shots.), or 8+Rapid Fire bonus if using a mounted weapon.
	1. While this is not very accurate, it puts shots in the air at enemies while still allowing you to move up to half your speed (because it is a type of All-Out Attack).
	2. **(HOUSE RULE)** anyone in that zone must make a Fright check **(/HOUSE RULE)**.

#### Hit 'Em Where it Hurts
1. Enemies tend to wear the most armor on their torsos, and the next most armor on their heads. You can try to shoot for more exposed body parts to deal with less armor. This incurs an attack penalty appropriate to the targeted area (see the Cheat Sheet or B398-399).
	1. Note that taking even a small penalty like -3 to hit is a big reduction in your chances to hit!
	2. Shooting Blind and Suppression Fire cannot target a hit location on purpose, and in fact hit a random location on their body (which might hit their cover, but also might hit a vital area!)
2. Hitting the Skull or Eye deals x4 damage *after* armor is deducted. This multiple replaces the one for your weapon's damage type (so for a pi+ weapon, you get x4 *instead of* x1.5)
3. Hitting the Vitals deals x3 damage *after* armor is deducted, but only for Impaling and Piercing damage attacks (which includes guns). This multiple replaces the one for your weapon's damage type (so for a pi+ weapon, you get x3 *instead of* x1.5)
4. Hitting the Skull or Face triggers a HT check against being Stunned, just as if the blow dealt 1/2 their max HP in one hit (so long as at least 1 damage is dealt after armor).
5. Hitting the arms or legs can cripple the limb if enough damage is dealt in one shot; however, weapons that deal imp, pi+, and pi++ damage are reduced to 1x *after* armor is deducted. If 1/2 max HP (legs) or 1/3 max HP (arms) are dealt in one shot, the limb is crippled, but all extra damage is lost.
6. If you can get your hands on it, hollow-point rounds and armor-piercing rounds (see [[Personal Weaponry]]) change how much of your damage is reduced by armor, but also how much damage is dealt after armor. This can help you optimize your damage strategy.
