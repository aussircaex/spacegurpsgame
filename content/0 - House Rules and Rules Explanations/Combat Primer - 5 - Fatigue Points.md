During combat, you can spend Fatigue Points (FP) in a number of ways to gain an advantage. Robots that do not have FP cannot spend it, but also can't lose it and suffer no ill effects for having low FP. These are my approved list of "Extra Effort" actions. You can spend as many FP as you want per turn.
##### Making Extra Effort in Combat
- **Heroic Charge**: 1 FP. Ignore the -2/-Bulk penalty for using Move And Attack
- **Feverish Defense**: 1 FP. Get +2 to *one* defense roll.
	- This applies to the single Dodge roll you make against multiple shots fired.
	- You can spend FP repeatedly if you take multiple attacks in a turn.
- **Flurry of Fire (or Flurry of Blows)**: 1 FP per shot. Reduce the -6 penalty for using Rapid Strike to -3 for that attack. (See "Shoot at Two Targets", [[Combat Primer - 3 - Gun Combat]]).
- **Multi-Task:** 1 FP. Take an ordinary combat round, but also perform one simple non-combat action, such as hitting the lights, starting a car, or closing a door.
- **Near Thing:** 1 FP. Avert the results of a failed DX roll to stay standing, avoid falling when climbing during combat (as in, hanging onto a ledge), or dropping your weapon due to a critical miss.
- **Shake it Off**: 1 FP. Avert the effects of a failed HT roll to avoid knockdown or unconsciousness.
	- "Knockdown" checks happens if you take half your max HP in one hit, or if you're hit in the vitals or head (skull, face, eyes).
	- You have to make HT rolls every turn you're at 0 HP or less to avoid falling unconscious, so this lets you keep going for 1 more round (per FP spent).
		- You can't use this to avoid dying instantly at -1xHP or worse. Nice try.

##### Getting Tired
- If a combat lasts 10 or more rounds (and a serious fight might well; GURPS rounds are 1 second each, not 6), you expend 1+your Encumbrance level FP at the end of the fight (e.g. if you have Medium Encumbrance, you would expend 3 FP). Add 2 if you're wearing armor that would reasonably be described as "hot" to wear, and +1 if the weather is hot.
	- Machines never suffer this penalty.
- If the party travels on foot, you expend 2 FP per hour, +1 for hot weather.
	- If combat breaks out at any point, you instantly lose the FP as though you walked the full hour.
	- Machines never suffer this penalty.
- If you try to carry more than 10x your Basic Lift (up to a maximum of 15x), you expend 1 FP *per second*.
	- Machines never suffer this penalty.
- If your characters need to sprint or jog long distances (not in combat time-frames), you start making HT rolls and expend FP when you fail.
	- Machines never need to make these rolls and thus can sprint as much as they like.
- Swimming rules are on B354-355, but basically, you make Swimming checks to keep your head above water, and failure costs 1 FP each time.
	- Machines that need to breathe do not have FP, and so *suffer HP damage instead*.
	- Machines with Doesn't Breathe (or anyone for that matter) do not take the FP damage but must still make Swimming checks to keep their head above water (i.e. from sinking).

##### Reaching Exhaustion
- Note that if you have less than 1/3 of your max HP left, your Move, Dodge, and ST are halved (rounded up).
- If your have 0 or less FP, you take 1 HP of damage for each further 1 FP you lose. You must make a Will roll to do anything other than talk or rest. If in combat, you must make that same Will roll each turn or Do Nothing.
	- Failing this roll at any time means you collapse and are incapacitated until you have at least 1 FP.
- If you have -1xFP, you automatically fall unconscious. Any further FP loss inflicted on you does HP damage.

##### Recovering
- Resting quietly - not walking around / making skill checks - restores 1 FP every 10 minutes
- Naturally, that means that a full night's sleep restores up to 48 FP.
