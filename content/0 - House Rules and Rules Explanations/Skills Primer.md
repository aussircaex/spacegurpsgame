If you are finding the calculation for skills confusing, you might find it helpful to think of them this way:

- At a baseline/anchor, your level in any given skill is equal to its relevant stat, -4.
	- e.g. untrained Guns is DX-4
- For an Average/Hard/Very Hard skill, take a -1/2/3 penalty
	- e.g. untrained Physician (IQ/Hard) is IQ-6
- Your first Skill Level you put into a skill gives you a +4 bonus. Each SL thereafter is +1
	- e.g. having 2 Skill Levels in Physician (IQ/Hard) is IQ-1
- Your first SL in a given skill costs 1 point, the second SL also costs 1 point, the third SL costs 2 points, and every SL thereafter costs 4 points.
- If you have a broad selection of skills you want to level up, you can increase your base stat for its relevant cost
	- e.g. you can increase your IQ by 1 for 20 points, which will give you an effective +1 to all IQ skills
- Bonuses from abilities like Talents are *not* the same thing as Skill Levels, and so do not grant the initial +4 bonus.
- Skills assume you have the necessary equipment. See the rulebook pg. B345 for full details, but as a rule-of-thumb:
	- Take an automatic -2 if you have to improvise your tools, such as bandaging a wound with a t-shirt, or a bobby pin for a lockpick.
	- For 5x the price of standard, you can buy "Good" quality equipment that gives you a +1
