During combat, you can spend Fatigue Points (FP) in a number of ways to gain an advantage. Robots that do not have FP cannot spend it, but also can't lose it and suffer no ill effects for having low FP. These are my approved list of "Extra Effort" actions.

You can spend as many FP as you want per turn.

- **Heroic Charge**: 1 FP. Ignore the -2/-Bulk penalty for using Move And Attack
- **Feverish Defense**: 1 FP. Get +2 to *one* defense roll.
	- This applies to the single Dodge roll you make against multiple shots fired.
	- You can spend FP repeatedly if you take multiple attacks in a turn.
- **Flurry of Fire (or Flurry of Blows)**: 1 FP per shot. Reduce the -6 penalty for using Rapid Strike to -3 for that attack. (See "Shoot at Two Targets", [[Combat Primer - 3 - Gun Combat]]).
- **Multi-Task:** 1 FP. Take an ordinary combat round, but also perform one simple non-combat action, such as hitting the lights, starting a car, or closing a door.
- **Near Thing:** 1 FP. Avert the results of a failed DX roll to stay standing, avoid falling when climbing during combat (as in, hanging onto a ledge), or dropping your weapon due to a critical miss.
- **Shake it Off**: 1 FP. Avert the effects of a failed HT roll to avoid knockdown or unconsciousness.
	- "Knockdown" checks happens if you take half your max HP in one hit, or if you're hit in the vitals or head (skull, face, eyes).
	- You have to make HT rolls every turn you're at 0 HP or less to avoid falling unconscious, so this lets you keep going for 1 more round (per FP spent).
		- You can't use this to avoid dying instantly at -1xHP or worse. Nice try.

##### Getting Tired
- Note that if you have less than 1/3 of your max HP left, your Move, Dodge, and ST are halved (rounded up).
- If your have 0 or less FP, you take 1 HP of damage for each further 1 FP you lose. You must make a Will roll to do anything other than talk or rest. If in combat, you must make that same Will roll each turn or Do Nothing.
	- Failing this roll at any time means you collapse and are incapacitated until you have at least 1 FP.
- If you have -1xFP, you automatically fall unconscious. Any further FP loss inflicted on you does HP damage.

##### Recovering
- Resting quietly - not walking around / making skill checks - restores 1 FP every 10 minutes
- Naturally, that means that a full night's sleep restores up to 48 FP.
