The basic principles for defending against ballistic weaponry have not changed in hundreds of years, but in the modern era, the protection offered by the best armors are quite advanced indeed. Powerful militaries and the best-equipped mercenary companies can provide full-body armors that can resist all but the most powerful weaponry.

--Game Rules--
•Our game is considered TL9 for the purposes of armor. This means the Ballistic Vest, Tactical Vest, and Ballistic Helmet have their DR increased by 50% at the same cost (plus any that I may have missed; see B285, note 3)

•You can freely purchase Legality Class 3 and 4 armor. Unlike guns, you may *not* purchase Legality Class 2 armor, even from smugglers or illicit arms dealers.

•If, for whatever reason, you wish to use armor made of steel (such as chain mail or plate armor), you may either pay half price for armor that also weighs half as much, or get double the listed DR at the same price and weight. (See note in *High-Tech* page 65 if interested). This is not unheard of; mail is worn for protection against sharks, for example, and many commonly-available armors are vests or jackets only; adding metal arm and leg armors can be prudent.

•Well-armored enemies can have very high DR values. If you risk (or plan) to fight such enemies, you should consider deliberately attacking unarmored areas of their body, or using high-powered weapons or armor-piercing ammunition.
