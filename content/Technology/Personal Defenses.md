The basic principles for defending against ballistic weaponry have not changed in hundreds of years, but in the modern era, the protection offered by the best armors are quite advanced indeed. Powerful militaries and the best-equipped mercenary companies can provide full-body armors that can resist all but the most powerful weaponry.

--Game Rules--
•Our game is considered TL9 for the purposes of armor. This means the Ballistic Vest, Tactical Vest, and Ballistic Helmet have their DR increased by 50% at the same cost (plus any that I may have missed; see B285, note 3)

•You can freely purchase Legality Class 4 armor. You can access Legality Class 3 armor if you acquire a Defensive Equipment License or equivalent for the government of the region. This will usually involve fees and a background check, so beware of that.
	Unlike guns, you may *not* purchase Legality Class 2 armor, even from smugglers or illicit arms dealers.

•All armor listed under the "Low-Tech Armor Table" (B283-284) are LC4 if they're more restricted on that list. At advanced tech levels like our game, **Metal armors in this section have double the listed DR for the same weight and cost**, or, optionally, have the same DR at half the weight and cost (see High-Tech page 65). This means that metal pieces can sometimes be a cheap and widely available stopgap if more advanced tech isn't available.
	-Example: a Ballistic Helmet is a great DR 18, but it's $250 and LC3. A Pot Helm gives you a decent 8 for only $100 and freely available at LC4. With 2 free DR for your skull, 10 DR is good protection against shrapnel and pistol fire (e.g. average damage for a 9mm pistol is 9).

•Well-armored enemies can have very high DR values. If you risk (or plan) to fight such enemies, you should consider deliberately attacking unarmored areas of their body, or using high-powered weapons or armor-piercing ammunition.
