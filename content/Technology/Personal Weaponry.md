While the technologies for laser weapons and blasters exist and are widely used for vehicle-mounted armaments, they are far too difficult and expensive to miniaturize to be practical for personal weaponry, and so classic ballistic guns, not too different from the ones built around the turn of the 3rd millennium, are still widely used.

--Game Rules--
•You will generally encounter guns of up to TL8, and not Ultra-Tech guns like Beam Weapons or Blaster Rifles. You can purchase weapons up to TL8.

•You can freely purchase Legality Class 3 and 4 weaponry and ammo. You may only purchase Legality Class 2 weaponry and ammo from specialist arms dealers, and they cost twice as much as 
listed (unless you somehow acquire authorization to own such weapons).

•Specialty ammos are available per their rules (B279-280):
   -Hollow-Point ammunition is equal in cost to ordinary full metal jacket rounds and at the same LC. DR values are doubled against HP ammo, but it adds +50% (additive) damage after DR.
   -Armor-Piercing Hard Core ("Armor Piercing") ammunition is only available at LC2, and thus must be bought from arms dealers. It is already twice as expensive, and is thus 4x as expensive for you to buy from such vendors. DR values are halved against AP ammo, but it does -50% (subtractive) damage after DR (meaning a .44 magnum would deal 3d damage instead of 3d x1.5 damage).
   -Armor-Piercing Discarding-Sabot ("Sabot") ammunition is LC1, and thus you cannot purchase it under normal circumstances. It is priced at 5x normal cost, if relevant. DR values are halved against Sabot ammo, and it does -50% (subtractive) damage after DR, but it does +1 damage per die and extends the weapon's range by 50%

•Armor is more advanced than firearm technology, going up to TL9 (if rare and extremely expensive), so advanced strategies may be necessary if you plan to solve your problems with violence against well-armored foes...
