Sometimes simply known as "AI", Artificial General Intelligence refers to when a computer system has achieved sapience - that is, it is "alive". AGIs develop memories, personality, experiences, and are capable of expressive themselves through art.

Humanity first developed AGI technology with the development of the Terraformers - large spaceships whose computer systems spanned the whole vessel, allowing for the computing power necessary for true intelligence to emerge. Though humanity initially feared what they had created, the Terraformers were friendly to humanity and happily performed their intended role to terraform worlds for humans to settle on.

Most of the Terraformers were destroyed by the invasion of  [[The Universal Union]], which also destroyed the science and knowledge necessary to rebuild them.

Humanity has not yet widely redeveloped the technology to construct AGI, though individual cases of AGI emerging unexpectantly or by unique brilliant engineers have been reported, but have not been replicated reliably.

AGI is not to be confused with [[Virtual Intelligence]], which are advanced computer systems that can *simulate* human conversation, but are not truly alive.
