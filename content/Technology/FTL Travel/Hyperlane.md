Hyperlanes are massive interstellar highways that allow for extremely rapid interstellar travel along a fixed path. They are known to be constructed by the [[The Universal Union]], A ship can enter or exit a hyperlane at any point along its path. While on the hyperlane, a ship is accelerated to approximately 700L, using the scale used by [[Travel Drives]], meaning they can travel about 700 light-years per day at that speed.

The Union build only one Hyperlane in the Terran Sector. Its terminus lies nearby to Earth. The lane itself quickly rises above the "plane" that most of the Terran sector sits on, and so it is not useful for traveling among the planets of the sector itself. Its other terminus is in the Achernar system, about 130ly from Sol, and thus a trip from one end to the other takes about five hours.

Terran scientists understand the principles behind Hyperlane construction, leading to some discussion of building a network of lanes within the sector, but the scale of the project is orders of magnitude above what humanity is capable of in the modern age.
