An original development of humanity, Jump Gates are massive structures that allow instantaneous travel between two points: simply enter a Gate and emerge from the other Gate, wherever it happens to be.

The advanced dark energy mathematics of Jump technology require that any new Gate must be built in close proximity to another it is connected to. Because of this, Gates do not allow for two disconnected planets to construct their own Gates and pair them; the Gates must both be built on one side and then physically traveled to its destination.

The earliest Jump Gates only functioned in specific pairs - that is, one Gate always linked to one and only one other Gate. Due to this limitation, a "Great Ring Garden" developed near to Earth, where a large collection of Gates could be accessed with convenience. Newer Gates, called Mark 2, constructed shortly before the conquest by [[The Universal Union]], could be "networked" together, allowing travelers to set their destination to any gate within that network.

Jump technology was the reason for the Union's invasion: it was, according to the invaders, a completely new technological advancement not seen elsewhere in the galaxy. The Gates were all shut down to prevent humanity from defending itself. However, thanks to the efforts of great heroes on Earth, all the research and knowledge of Jump technology was destroyed to prevent it falling into Union hands.

Jump Gates mostly remain dormant to this day. The majority of older Gates were paired to Earth, and thus there is little reason to reactivate them. Some of the largest political factions in the Terran Sector have begun attempting to reactivate Mark 2 Gates, but the enormous energy requirements for their use are prohibitive to all but their most important military and dignitary missions.
