Travel Drives are the standard type of Faster-Than-Light technology used in the Terran Sector, and is indeed the only type that can be built as an engine for spacecraft.

Travel drives, occasionally known as Warp drives, are Alcubierre-type engines that contract space in front of the vehicle and expand space behind it, allowing for FTL "speeds" without actually accelerating to a high fraction of c.

The travel speeds available have improved over the centuries, and are presently capable of reaching a cruising speed of approximately one light-year per day. Industry standards have calibrated this speed as the meter stick for rating a ship's max speed, using the unit "L". A ship that can travel 1.1 light-years per day at cruising speed is thus rated as "1.1L".

Travel Drives are extremely sensitive. Due to a combination of factors ranging from safety features to the sheer delicacy of their construction, Travel Drives cannot be engaged or remain engaged if the ship is under too much distress. Collisions, whether from micrometeors or enemy fire, will cause the engines to disengage. Ships traveling between stars can thus be "knocked out" of FTL by attackers lying in wait. Pilots of all walks of life cheekily refer to such attacks as a "warning shot".
