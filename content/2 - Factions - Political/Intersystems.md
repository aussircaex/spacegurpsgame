The Intersystems are a region ringed by star systems including Sol, the Sengoku systems, and the Irish League.  The region is considered "empty space" in terms of having no visible-spectrum main-sequence stars, but is fairly dense with asteroid fields, rogue planets, and other places of note.

As the region sits among the first stars that humanity explored and colonized, there are a great number of space stations that were constructed to serve as waystations during the early, slow days of interstellar travel. Built to last and build for large permanent populations, these stations are numerous and house millions of permanent inhabitants.

The region is also relatively lawless; while each space station has government, they are very weak, due to the fact that space stations do not possess natural resources to control. With the assistance of the star systems surrounding the region, they tend to exert most control over commerce, to prevent the region's violence from becoming even more of an arms race than it already is.

However, actual law enforcement usually falls to the prevalent mercenary companies, organized crime families, gangs, and simple vigilante justice and lynch mobs.
