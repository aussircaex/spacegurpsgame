The Universal Union is a massive and powerful empire in the Milky Way that controlled the Terran sector for just under a century.

Originating somewhere on the Sagittarius Arm of the galaxy on the far side of the galactic core, the founding species of the Union achieved spaceflight approximately 3000 years ago; one of the earlier arrivals on the galactic stage. About 800 years ago, they began unifying with other species into a Federation. 400 years ago, the Federation's democratic traditions collapsed and transformed into the aggressive oligarchic empire it is today, whereupon it began conquering more peoples that had not voluntarily joined its Federation.

Humanity and its worlds were one of those peoples, with the Union arriving about 300 years ago.

Then, after 98 years, a calamity struck the Union - a supernova obliterated the cluster of systems that formed their core worlds, destroying a major portion of their population and power. With their power diminished, they withdrew from the Terran sector to devote resources elsewhere - but not before torching the surface of Earth in an event known as the Great Conflagration.

The Union, or at least a remnant faction, still controls the exit to the Hyperlane that leaves the Terran Sector, and officially enforce a blockade.
